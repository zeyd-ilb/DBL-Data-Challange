When running the ChatBot code, some warning messages will appear. This is a feature of the RoBERTa model and can be safely ignored.
You will be prompted to enter a tweet, and then the code will return the following:
- It will give you the calculated compound RoBERTa sentiment score
- It will give you the broad category (this is for the ctaegorising design of the ChatBot, this can be ignored)
- It will give you the category it classified your input into
- It will give you a pre-written response for this category

For example:
My flight was cancelled and I didn't get a refund
-0.8368757083080709
Broad Category: Flight Issues (Confidence: 0.83)
Specific Category: Cancelled Flight (Confidence: 0.58)
Response: We're sorry your flight was cancelled. Please contact our support team for rebooking options.

If the sentiment score of the input is less than -0.3 (meaning the calculated compound score by the RoBERTa model), then the model will return:
- It will give you the calculated compound RoBERTa sentiment score
- "This tweet is not a complaint!"

For example:
I love british airways
0.9633015925064683
This tweet is not a complaint!
